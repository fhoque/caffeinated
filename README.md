<h3>Project Pitch</h3>

<p>Coffee. It’s the one drink no one can live without. It’s sold on the corner of every neighborhood in countries around the world.  It’s enjoyed by rich and poor alike and it seems that wherever you go, there’s always a special variety enjoyed by the locals. Whether its a latte or cappuccino, frappe or iced coffee, the vendors of these pick-me-ups know what they are doing.</p>  

<p>Surely you’ve enjoyed one of these drinks before, but what exactly goes on behind that counter?  How do they do it? The starbucks and caribous of the world? The dunkins and peets?  People line up in droves and hand over hard earned money just to guzzle down their latest caffeine-laced concoctions. There must be some guide to its preparation, some school where all these masters learned their barista ways...</p>

<h3>Compelling User Interface</h3>

<p>This interface will be compelling from an educational perspective because it will show users in a simple and sequential manner how to make any type of coffee drink that they desire. The interface will first allow the user to specify their coffee preferences in a general way. Does the user have a preference for drinks that are
<ul>
	<li>hot or cold</li>
	<li>a particular flavor</li>
	<li>within a higher or lower dose of caffeine</li>
	<li>etc.</li>

The user will gradually be introduced to the specifics of how to make the drink best suited to their preferences and selection. These instructions will be accompanied by pictures and illustrations to increase clarity.</p>

<p>The interface will also feature more in-depth options for those who already know how to brew coffee, but would like to learn how to make new types of drinks. Users will be prompted up-front to specify their level of knowledge, and the interface will scale accordingly so that both new and experienced users can find the information that interests them.</p>
