<h3>Project Pitch</h3>

<p>Coffee. It’s the one drink no one can live without. It’s sold on the corner of every neighborhood in countries around the world.  It’s enjoyed by rich and poor alike and it seems that wherever you go, there’s always a special variety enjoyed by the locals. Whether its a latte or cappuccino, frappe or iced coffee, the vendors of these pick-me-ups know what they are doing.</p>  

<p>Surely you’ve enjoyed one of these drinks before, but what exactly goes on behind that counter?  How do they do it? The starbucks and caribous of the world? The dunkins and peets?  People line up in droves and hand over hard earned money just to guzzle down their latest caffeine-laced concoctions. There must be some guide to its preparation, some school where all these masters learned their barista ways...</p>

<h3>Target Users</h3>

<p>Coffee enthusiasts, cafe frequenters, coffee skeptics. Anyone interested in brewing their own cafe drinks at home will benefit from this application.</p>

<p>This interface will be appropriate both for new coffee drinkers and for those who already know how to make coffee, but would like to learn to brew new varieties at home. For novice users, there will be a step by step tutorial on how to brew coffee. Advanced users, however, will be able to quickly access information about different varieties of coffee.</p>

<h3>Educational Intent</h3>

<p>This application will educate users on how to brew different varieties of coffee. After using the application, users should feel confident in their ability to brew many types of coffee at home.</p>

<h3>Compelling User Interface</h3>

<p>This interface will be compelling from an educational perspective because it will show users in a simple and sequential manner how to make any type of coffee drink that they desire. The interface will first allow the user to specify their coffee preferences in a general way. Does the user have a preference for drinks that are
<ul>
	<li>hot or cold</li>
	<li>a particular flavor</li>
	<li>within a higher or lower dose of caffeine</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
The user will gradually be introduced to the specifics of how to make the drink best suited to their preferences and selection. These instructions will be accompanied by pictures and illustrations to increase clarity.</p>

<p>The interface will also feature more in-depth options for those who already know how to brew coffee, but would like to learn how to make new types of drinks. Users will be prompted up-front to specify their level of knowledge, and the interface will scale accordingly so that both new and experienced users can find the information that interests them.</p>

<h1>Interface Goals</h1>
<h2>Shneiderman’s Five Criteria</h2>
<p>The rankings for this application according to Shneiderman’s criteria are given in the table below.</p>
<p>[insert table]</p>

<h2>User Interface Goals</h2>
<h3>Speed of Performance</h3>
<p>The application will allow both new and advanced users to quickly find the information that is of interest to them.  To facilitate this goal, the interface will scale based on the user’s knowledge of coffee-making.  New users will be offered an in-depth tutorial on the process of brewing coffee, while advanced users will be offered a streamlined process for finding out about new coffee drinks.  These two levels of the interface will be presented as options to the user that they can choose based on their knowledge of coffee-making.</p>

<h3>Time to Learn</h3>
<p>The application will not be time consuming to learn for new users.  The interface will be straightforward and concise so that users will not have to think too much about how they should use it.  The terminology used will be appropriate to the user, and the definitions of domain-specific terms will be clearly conveyed by the interface.  The intent is that users will spend most of their time with the application learning how to make coffee rather than learning how to use the interface.</p>

<h3>Subjective Satisfaction</h3>
<p>The application will provide users with information regarding the uses, side effects, interactions and warnings related to drinking coffee. It will also update the user with new recipes. In addition, users will be presented with fun features such as step-by-step guides and games.  Last, but not least, the application will give the user some insight on the history of drinking coffee.  All of these features will be provided in order to make the application enjoyable to use in addition to being informative.</p>

<h3>Avoiding User Errors</h3>
<p>Since this application will provide options for new and advanced users, both types of users will be less likely to commit errors due to the interface not accommodating their skill level.  In addition, the interface will be simple and concise for all users in order to prevent confusion and decrease the chance of errors.  However, because the consequences of a user error in this application would be minor, this particular criteria will not be emphasized in this interface.</p>

<h3>Retention over time</h3>
<p>The simplicity of the interface, along with its step-by-step nature, will make it so that the user will not have to learn much in order to use the interface properly.  This will ensure that a repeat user will have an easy time using the interface again, because there will be less things to remember.</p>
