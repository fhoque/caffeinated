<h1>User Interface Design and Development</h1>
<h2>Project Description - SWE 632 Fall 2012</h2>
During the semester you will work on a semester-long group project. This project is focussed on the DESIGN of a user interface. The overall theme for the project this semester is something educational. The project must educate someone about something. Think broadly about this topic, it could range from an educational website to a mobile application about local geography features to a simulation for first responders to learn how to handle emergency situations. Be creative and have fun!

<h3>Technology</h3> This can be anything you want, (mobile apps, web apps, Unix, Mac, PC, PHP, HTML 5, Java, J2EE, VB, .Net etc...) but remember the goal is user interface design. This isn't the time to learn a completely new technology! Pick something your group has experience with. You must be able to demo the project to me on-campus though!

<h3>Team</h3> I encourage you to work in teams of 3. Design is iterative, and requires ideas to be discussed. Doing that alone is hard :-). However, you can still choose to work in teams from 1-4 people. No more than 4! The requirements for individuals and teams are the same, however each team member will submit an individual evaluation of the other team members at the end of the project.

<h2>Project Milestones</h2>

<h3>Statement of Intent</h3>
A short document with your team members' names, your team name (something fun), and a pitch for what you plan to do. Make sure to  include in the document who your users are, what you will be teaching, what technology you will use, and why you think this user interface will be compelling for the educational intent.

<h3>User Profiles</h3>
A short user profile containing a description of the users of your system. This description should have two components. The first should describe whether your primary users will be novice, knowledgeable intermittent, or expert. This description should consider the users in terms of syntactic, task semantic, and computer semantic knowledge. The second component should consider characteristics of the users that we discuss in class, including work experience, computer experience, age, etc. You should form these as provisional personnas as we did in class. Include if they are a primary or a served persona. You don't need to model negative personas. Please refrain from including information about design; think of this as part of the requirements. Design will come later. 

<h3>Interface Goals</h3>
(1) describe user interface goals in terms of Shneiderman's five criteria, and

(2) describe all the features you plan to implement in your system. The second part must define all functionalities that you plan to implement in the system. Please refrain from including information about design; think of this as part of the requirements. Design will come later. 

<h3>Technology Demonstration</h3>
Build and submit a simple technology demonstration interface using the same platform, implementation package, and interface style that your final project will use. The purpose of the technological demo is to ensure that you can use the software you plan to use and make it available to me. There is no requirement for any real functionality here... just an ability to "run it" so I can ensure in the final submission I can see your work. (If this isn't obvious for your technology choice, talk to me... we can work it out.)

<h3>Initial Interface Design</h3>
Initial interface screen design (can be on paper, PowerPoint, Balsamiq, etc... not a working a prototype!) â€” the screens and a description of the interaction. If the user profile describes a user who is significantly different from me, you may need to include task-semantic knowledge about the application so that I can evaluate your screens. You should also include comments on how the screens operate.

<h3>Presentation</h3>
You should prepare a 10 minute presentation about your project. The presentation should include a short demo, a description of your users, the goals you had, the choices you made when implementing your design (and why), and any other lessons learned.

<h3>Final Submission</h3>
- Each team submits a single written report including 
- Your team names, and team member names
- A one or two sentence description of your project
- A paragraph describing the software you used to build your interface
- A short description of how I can use and run your project
- A short description of the software design
- Any notes or problems that I should be aware of (that is, things that don't work)

<h3>Team Evaluation</h3>
If you are on a team of more than one person, EVERY MEMBER must individually submit a team evaluation on Blackboard. The format in Word and PDF.
