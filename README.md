<h3>Project Pitch</h3>

<p>Coffee. It’s the one drink no one can live without. It’s sold on the corner of every neighborhood in countries around the world.  It’s enjoyed by rich and poor alike and it seems that wherever you go, there’s always a special variety enjoyed by the locals. Whether its a latte or cappuccino, frappe or iced coffee, the vendors of these pick-me-ups know what they are doing.</p>  

<p>Surely you’ve enjoyed one of these drinks before, but what exactly goes on behind that counter?  How do they do it? The starbucks and caribous of the world? The dunkins and peets?  People line up in droves and hand over hard earned money just to guzzle down their latest caffeine-laced concoctions. There must be some guide to its preparation, some school where all these masters learned their barista ways...</p>

<h3>Compelling User Interface</h3>

<p>This interface will be compelling from an educational perspective because it will show users in a simple and sequential manner how to make any type of coffee drink that they desire.

	<li>hot or cold</li>
	<li>a particular flavor</li>
	<li>within a higher or lower dose of caffeine</li>
