<h3>Target Users</h3>

<p>Coffee enthusiasts, cafe frequenters, coffee skeptics. Anyone interested in brewing their own cafe drinks at home will benefit from this application.</p>

<p>This interface will be appropriate both for new coffee drinkers and for those who already know how to make coffee, but would like to learn to brew new varieties at home. For novice users, there will be a step by step tutorial on how to brew coffee. Advanced users, however, will be able to quickly access information about different varieties of coffee.</p>

<h3>Educational Intent</h3>

<p>This application will educate users on how to brew different varieties of coffee. After using the application, users should feel confident in their ability to brew many types of coffee at home.</p>

<p>This interface will be compelling from an educational perspective because it will show users in a simple and sequential manner how to make any type of coffee drink that they desire. The interface will first allow the user to specify their coffee preferences in a general way. Does the user have a preference for drinks that are
</p><ul>
<li>hot or cold</li>
    <li>a particular flavor</li>
    <li>within a higher or lower dose of caffeine</li>
    <li>etc.</li>

The user will gradually be introduced to the specifics of how to make the drink best suited to their preferences and selection. These instructions will be accompanied by pictures and illustrations to increase clarity.

<p>The interface will also feature more in-depth options for those who already know how to brew coffee, but would like to learn how to make new types of drinks. Users will be prompted up-front to specify their level of knowledge, and the interface will scale accordingly so that both new and experienced users can find the information that interests them.</p>
