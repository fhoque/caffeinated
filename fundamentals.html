		<h2 align=center>What is Coffee?</h2>
		<p>Coffee is a brewed beverage prepared from "Coffee Beans", which are the roasted seeds of the Coffea plant.  It is one of the most
		commonly consumed beverages in the world.  People prepare coffee at home, often using a coffeemaker, or purchase coffee drinks at
		coffeehouses.
		<p>According to historical records, the stimulating effects of coffee were first discovered in Ethiopia, and coffee was first consumed
		on a large scale in the Middle East.  Starting from the 16th century, coffee was exported to many other parts of the world, and it gained 
		a reputation for its supposed curative effects.  Since then, coffee has become one of the most widely traded commodities in the world.  Coffee Beans
		are typically cultivated in South America, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia.  These beans are then traded and sold around the world.
		<p>Coffee is often known for its energizing effect, which is the result of the high caffeine content of most coffee drinks.  This
		property explains why so many people around the world start their day with a cup of coffee.
		<p>Coffee comes in many varieties: from hot coffee to iced coffee, from decaf to espresso, from black coffee to lattes, there is
		a coffee drink for everyone.  This site will teach you about the many different types of coffee and show you how to prepare these drinks
		at home.

		<h3>Preparing Your First Cup of Coffee</h3>
		<p>If you have never prepared coffee before, it is easy to get started. You will need a few things first:
		<table align=center border=2><tr><th>Coffeemaker</th><th>Coffee Grounds</th><th>Coffee filter</th><th>Cold Water</th></tr>
		<tr><td><img width=100 height=100 src="images/coffeemaker.jpg"></td><td><img width=100 height=100 src="images/coffeegrounds.jpg"></td>
		<td><img width=100 height=100 src="images/coffeefilters.jpg"></td><td><img width=100 height=100 src="images/coldwater.jpg"></td></tr></table>
		<br><br>
		<p>You can purchase coffee grounds and coffee filters at any supermarket.  A coffeemaker can be purchased from most department stores.  
		Once you have these materials, you are ready to make your first cup of coffee!
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 1:</b>
		<p>Place the coffee filter in the coffee filter container on top of the coffeemaker.  Note that some coffee makers come with permanent 
		filters, so you should consult your owner's manual before using a disposable coffee filter.
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 2:</b>
		<p>Insert coffee grounds into the coffee filter.  You should insert a tablespoon of coffee grounds for every cup (8 ounces) that you 
		plan to prepare.
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 3:</b>
		<p>Fill the coffeemaker pot with cold water equal to the amount of cups you plan to make.  You can use the markings on the pot or the
		cup you plan to drink from in order to measure the water.
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 4:</b>
		<p>Pour the water in the pot into the water container at the top of the coffeemaker.  Make sure not to spill any!
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 5:</b>
		<p>Place the coffee pot on its stand and close the water container.
		<br><br>
		<b>Step 6:</b>
		<p>Press the start button on your coffee maker.
		<br><br>
		
		Once the coffee maker is done brewing the coffee, pour it into your coffee mug and enjoy!
		
		Now that you know how to make a simple cup of coffee, <a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;" href="questionnaire.html">perhaps you would like to search for a recipe.</a>
